  <div name="Hello, JavaScript!">
    Welcome to JavaScript, a very useful language!

    Here we have a simple "Hello World!" program. Try running it now, either by
    clicking *Run*, or pressing *Shift-Enter*.

    JavaScript is an _imperative_ language, meaning that it does just what you
    tell it to, one thing at a time, in order. In this case, we have told it to
    do exactly one thing, which is to show an alert window containing the text
    |Hello, JavaScript!|. This text is called a *string* (of characters).

    Once you've tried out some exercises, navigate to other slides using the
    navigation arrows or the *Page-Up* and *Page-Down* keys.

    Exercises

    - Try running the program with a quotation mark missing. What happens? What
      if you swap |"| for |'| everywhere?

    - Change the string to say hello specifically to you.

    - Print 'Hello, JavaScript!' using two strings instead of one, like this:
      |alert('Hello ' + 'JavaScript!')|.

    --

    alert("Hello, JavaScript!");
  </div>
  <div name="Comments">
    JavaScript (and many other languages) ignores **comments**: bits of text
    that start with |//| and extend to the end of the line. They are strictly
    for humans to read, and do not affect how your program runs.

      // This is a comment.

    There is also a multi-line version, delimited with two special symbols:

      /* This is a
         multi-line
         comment. */

    These are customarily formatted as seen in the code window, with repeated
    asterisks and the terminator on a line by itself, but that is merely
    convention. What makes it a comment is the way it begins and ends.

    Comments are useful for making notes to yourself
    or others about how the program's code works.

    Note that comment delimiters like |//| or |/*| and |*/| have to stand alone
    syntactically to form a comment; if they appear within a string, then they
    are just part of the string.

    Exercises

    - Output a string with a comment delimiter inside of it, e.g., |alert("Not // a comment!")|.

    --

    // This is a line comment. Line comments start
    // with '//' and extend to the end of the line.

    /* This is a multi-line comment.
     * This formatting (with repeated asterisks) is
     * conventional. The comment terminator stands alone.
     */

    alert("This is not a comment.");
  </div>
  <div name="Variables">
    A **variable** is a place to remember something.
    You assign a value to a variable using the
    **assignment operator** (a single |=|) like this:

      var a = "hi";
      var A = "hello";

    Now the _variable_ |a| contains the _string_ |"hi"| and |A| contains
    |"hello"|. Yes, case matters: |a| is not the same as |A|.

    In JavaScript, variables spring into existence when they are declared with
    |var| *or* assigned a value. Before that they do not exist, and referring
    to them is an error (see the exercises). It is typical to declare and
    assign at the same time. Until more is explained later about when it is
    appropriate to omit it (hardly ever, it turns out), always use |var| when
    assigning a variable for the first time.

    A valid **variable name** can contain letters, numbers, and the characters
    |_| and |$|, but cannot begin with a number (it can also use a substantial
    set of Unicode characters, but we'll stick with plain ASCII for this
    tutorial). A variable can contain any kind of value.

    Exercises

    - Try assiging to a variable name that starts with a number
      (like |1eet|). See what happens.

    - Assign a new variable to an existing one, e.g.,
      |b = a|. Output it.

    --

    var a = "hi there";  // 'a' now contains a string of text.
    alert(a);

    // Here we *reassign* 'a' to contain a number. Note the lack of 'var'.
    a = 10;
    alert(a);

    // The $ is just another character. It has no special meaning.
    var $my_longer_varname = 14;
    alert($my_longer_varname);

    // Until assigned, variables do not exist.
    alert(i_dont_exist);
  </div>
  <div name="Numbers">
    JavaScript understands a few fundamental **types** of data. You have
    already encountered a couple of them, namely _strings_ like |"hello"| and
    _functions_ like |alert|. We'll get to functions later. For now, let's
    focus on numbers.

    You have already seen examples of numbers being assigned to variables, and
    it works fairly naturally. Numbers do pretty much what you'd expect them
    to. You can apply all of the basic mathematical operators to numbers:

      * Multiply
      + Add
      - Subtract
      / Divide
      % Remainder

    JavaScript represents all numbers in the same way underneath: as
    _double-width IEEE floating point_ numbers, but you won't need to know much
    about that for this tutorial. The important thing to know is that it knows
    how to treat numbers as integers, as well, and sometimes we'll lie a bit
    and pretend that it actually thinks of them that way.

    Exercises

    - Try adding |+| to the front of a number instead of |-|.

    - Try using the modulus operator |%| between a couple of integer numbers.
      What does it do?

    --

    // Normal decimal notation works great.
    var myInt1 = 15;
    var myInt2 = -25;

    // As does hexadecimal!
    var myInt3 = 0xdeadbeef;

    // Various styles of floating point are allowed,
    // including scientific notation.
    var myFloat0 = 1.0;
    var myFloat1 = 0.0423;
    var myFloat2 = 1e-5;
    var myFloat3 = 17.2e12;

    // Let's see what that hex number above looks like:
    alert(myInt3);

    // Now for some operators:
    alert(10 + 6);
    alert(15 - 21);
    alert(7 * 20);
    alert(7 / 12);

    // What is this value?
    var a = 3 + 50 * 2;

    // How about this?
    var a = (3 + 50) * 2;
 </div>
  <div name="Basic Syntax Rules">
    In the previous examples, we have taken it for granted that every statement
    ends in a semicolon. JavaScript is kind of funny this way, because strictly
    speaking, the semicolon is _not required_. There is a major caveat,
    however. Sometimes the computer can't tell whether you intend to end a
    statement or continue it.

    Because of this, strange and unexpected things can happen if you omit the
    semicolon. Consider the code window. There is an example of a case where
    JavaScript can figure out what you meant, and another where it cannot.

    There are many more such examples, so always be clear to the parser: use
    semicolons at the end of statements.

    Another important note: "whitespace" is not _usually_ significant. The
    indentation shown in these slides is for human consumption. The computer
    doesn't care about it. The same goes for blank lines, spaces between
    operators and numbers, between statements in function calls, etc.

    But this rule is not consistently applied. Where possible, JavaScript will
    insert a virtual semicolon for you at the end of a line if it thinks it
    can, and that can be tough to predict: it's best to just always use them.

    Exercises:

    - Before running the code, guess what the final output will be.

    --

    // This is fine. Not really ambiguous. Or is it?
    var a = "hi there"

    // This works, but it's sort of unclear that it should, because the end of
    // a line *usually* takes the place of a missing semicolon. This doesn't look
    // right to a human, but the parser handles it anyway. Many surprising errors
    // have been hidden by code just like this.
    var b = "hey "

        + "there"

    // It's even worse when you consider that the following is valid all by
    // itself. It produces the value 50.3, but the value is
    // immediately discarded:

    + 50.3

    // Therefore, so is this. Guess what it outputs.

    var c = "number "

    + 10

    alert(c);
  </div>
  <div name="String Escaping">
    There is no difference between |'| and |"| - they both form
    equivalent strings. People usually pick one based on preference,
    changing only to include quotes inside, like this:

      "Don't touch my quoting."
      'I need to "work", now.'

    Occasionally, you need to include both kinds of
    quotes inside of a string. In these cases, you can
    **escape** quotes using a backslash:

      "This string contains the \" delimiter."

    Strings accept other escape sequences, like |'\n'|, which inserts
    a line feed character, making a new line. More
    info can be found here:

    http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp

    Exercises

    - Try creating a string that contains a backslash:
      it will need to be escaped.

    --

    var message = ("This has a double quote \" inside.\n" +
                   'This has a single quote \' inside.\n' +
                   "This has a second line:\n  Yup.");

    alert(message);
  </div>
  <div name="Calling Functions">
    We are now ready to explain something we have been using all along:
    function calls. JavaScript has a lot of stuff built in that you can just
    use, and it exposes most of it through functions that you can call.

    A function is called by placing parentheses after its name. If it accepts
    **arguments**, then they go inside as in |alert("Hello there!")|, which
    should look familiar.

    All JavaScript functions also **return** something. This means that, in
    addition to taking arguments _in_, they also send values _out_. To obtain
    the returned value of a function, just use that function call in place of a
    value, e.g., |a = parseInt("1723")| or |alert(parseInt("1723"))|.

    You can call some functions with more than one value. In that case, supply
    values separated by commas, e.g., |Math.pow(2, 10)| (more on that later).

    Functions like |alert| are only used for their effect, so they implicitly
    return the special value |undefined|. Another such function specifically
    defined for convenience in this browser-based presentation is |_output|. It
    accepts any number of arguments and outputs all of them, separated by
    spaces, in the output window.

    Exercises

    - Try adding the strings |"2000"| to |"1000"|. Now try adding the result of
      |parseInt("2000")| to |parseInt("1000")|. What happened? What is |parseInt|
      doing?

    - Convert the string |"3.14159"| into a floating-point number with
      |parseFloat|.

    - Peruse the reference material at
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects

    --
    // This evaluates to the number 2423, but it never used, so that value
    // is discarded.
    parseInt("2423");

    // This is unique to this course. It is not a standard JavaScript function,
    // but is provided for convenience as you monkey around.
    _output("Hello, output window.");

    // Note that alert evaluates to undefined:
    var alertOutput = alert("hello");
    _output("output of alert: " + alertOutput);

    // You can convert strings to numbers:
    var intVal = parseInt("42");
    var floatVal = parseFloat("2.718281828");

    // Note, we're kind of glossing over something big here: adding a string to
    // a value first converts that value to a string, then joins them together.
    _output("intVal", intVal);
    _output("floatVal", floatVal);
    _output("double floatVal", (2 * floatVal));

    // Finally, you can plug evaluated functions directly into the arguments of
    // other functions. Many of these functions are in their own namespace, and
    // are specified by the namespace and a dot. Math, for example, has many
    // interesting and useful functions:
    _output(Math.floor(3.14159));
  </div>
  <div name="Objects and More Math">
    Now that we know about function calls, we can talk about some of the more
    interesting mathematical operations that are not expressed as symbols, like
    taking a square root.

    But first we need to talk a tiny bit about **objects**. You can think of a
    JavaScript object as something that groups stuff that belongs together.
    This definition will become more precise in time, but for now that is good
    enough.

    To access the stuff within an object, you name the object, put a dot after
    it, and name the thing inside, like this:

      Math.floor(55.3)

    This calls the |floor| function that is held by the built-in JavaScript
    |Math| object. There are many such built-in objects with many useful
    functions inside, including things that manipulate strings, dates, times,
    numbers, and elements on a web page that hosts your JavaScript.

    Exercises

    - Compute |Math.floor(52.5)| and |Math.ceil(52.5)|. What do these do?
      What if you use negative numbers?

    - Try adding a new value to the Math object by setting it, e.g.,
      |Math.myAwesomeValue = 42;|. Did it work?

    --

    _output("pi =", Math.PI);
    _output("sin(pi/2) =", Math.sin(Math.PI / 2));

    // Uh-oh - why is this not exactly equal to 0.5?
    // The answer lies in the IEEE floating point definition. Some numbers
    // cannot be expressed perfectly in floating point.
    _output("cos(pi/3) =", Math.cos(Math.PI / 3));

    _output("sin(pi/3) =", Math.sin(Math.PI / 3));

    _output("tan(pi/3) =", Math.tan(Math.PI / 3));

    // Square roots work:
    _output("sqrt(2) =", Math.sqrt(2));

    // And you can take other roots using negative powers:
    _output("cube root of 3 =", Math.pow(3, -3));

    _output("4 to the 3rd power =", Math.pow(4, 3));

    // Wait, did you expect this? How big is this number?
    _output("sin(pi) =", Math.sin(Math.PI));
  </div>
  <div name="Everything is an Object">
    Remember how we said that objects are sort of like containers that hold
    stuff inside of them? Well, it turns out that in JavaScript, _everything_
    is an object, including things like strings and numbers. The *prototypes*
    of these objects are |String| and |Number|, respectively (capitalization
    matters).

    A function that operates on the object that holds it is typically called a
    **method** of that object. You'll see the terms used interchangeably
    sometimes.

    For now, let's explore the idea that everything is an object. Strings, for
    example, have a few very useful methods, as do numbers. Take a look in the
    code window for some examples.

    Exercises

    - Look at the documentation for String at
      http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String .
      Try a few methods in the code window.

    --

    // The "length" member of every string tells you how many characters it
    // contains.
    _output("Hi there!".length);

    // The "slice" method takes a starting index and an ending index, and
    // returns a string from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive).
    _output("0123456789".slice(2, 5));

    // The "split" method allows you to split a string up into words, and
    // accepts a delimiter.
    _output("1:b:%".split(":"));

    // Variables are just names for things like strings, etc., so you can
    // obviously call methods on them as well.

    // The "trim" method removes space from the beginning and end of a string.
    var s = "  A string with leading and trailing space.   ";
    var s_trimmed = s.trim();
    _output("'" + s_trimmed + "'");

    // When doing this trick with numbers, you need parentheses, otherwise
    // it looks like you're specifying a floating point because of the dot.
    // Note that many objects have a "toString" method.
    _output((253).toString());
  </div>
  <div name="Getting Help">
    There are a lot of functions available in JavaScript itself. You can find
    documentation for these at a couple of popular places.

      Official: http://developer.mozilla.org/
      Popular: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref

    In addition to what the language itself has to offer, JavaScript usually
    runs in a **hosted environment**, which will expose its own variables,
    types, and functions that you can use to manipulate that environment.

    One of the most common hosted environments is the web browser, though
    you can also run JavaScript without a browser in environments like
    "node.js". We'll focus mostly on the browser for this tutorial.

    The point is that there are so many functions and variables available
    that even seasoned developers do their work with the documentation open
    all the time. Don't hesitate to keep the documents in front of you when
    you are working on solving a problem.

    Since we work within the web browser most of the time, it is useful to
    know what that environment is called. It is referred to as the "Document
    Object Model" or "DOM". Documentation for the DOM is often found
    side-by-side with generic JavaScript documentation, and that is certainly
    the case for http://www.w3schools.com/jsref, as well as for the official
    http://developer.mozilla.org/ site.

    Exercises

    - Poke around the two sites above and see if you can find the JavaScript
      documentation.

    - Now look for DOM documentation. They're organized slightly differently
      but you should see some big similarities once you drill down a bit.

    --

    // What is this? No idea? Try looking it up!
    // Also, remember how you can use a function call anywhere a value is needed?
    // What does this "chained replace" do below?
    //   REMINDER: the left side of dots like these has to be an object.
    var a = "\tHello there\n".replace("\t", "&lt;tab&gt;").replace("\n", "&lt;newline&gt;");

    _output(a);
